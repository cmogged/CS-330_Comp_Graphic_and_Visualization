##### How do I approach designing software?
When I design something new, I like to create lots of visual documentation. I like to use tools that are fast, minimal, and never become deprecated. This ensures that it does not become a hassle to document an idea. A difficult design process went into figuring out how to construct objects without using much trial and error. Taking my time and making good decisions at the beginning of the project kept things easy going.

##### How do I approach developing programs? 
When developing a new program, I prefer to start with a small, working version before expanding it and integrating it into the larger project. It is always a good idea to start small. Luckily, this project gave a lot of visual feedback. Most of the low-level functions were taken care of, so it was not too difficult to iterate and build to completion.

##### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? 
Computer science unlocks many doors. It is the one subject that can give a lead in most other subjects. Computational graphics and visualization interfaces human and machine. It merges the very general human brain with the sharp and logical computer brain, which can allow deeper problem solving.
